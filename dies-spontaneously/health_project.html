    Academic stress as a predictor of mental health in university students</a>
    <br>“The study revealed that Self-inflicted Stress was the most significant stressor among undergraduate students. This indicates that students’ self-demands and self-efficacy perceptions are essential factors in the development of high academic stress levels. There is a clear correlation between high levels of academic stress and the probability of experiencing Languishing Mental Health.”</li>
